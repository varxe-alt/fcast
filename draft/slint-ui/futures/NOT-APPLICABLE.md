# Moblin UI — Applicability Triage

This document tags every file under `draft/moblin-ui/Moblin/View/` (279 files +
`MainView.swift`) for whether it applies to the FCast Android sender Slint UI.

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the legend and the four user-excluded
categories (chat / navigation / replay / right-side overlays).

> **Format**: each section corresponds to a top-level `Moblin/View/<Section>/`
> directory. Within a section, files are listed alphabetically, with a tag and
> a one-line reason. Tags use the legend in `README.md`.
>
> **Goal**: when someone asks "what about Moblin's `XYZView.swift`?" the answer
> should be one `grep` away.

## Promotion mapping (Phases 12–27)

Per user direction (*"create a UI without functionality — placeholders for all
applicable-future / deferred entries"*), every entry tagged
`applicable-future` or `deferred — needs-rust-capability` in the per-section
tables below has been **promoted into a UI-only placeholder phase** under
`phases/`. The phase ships `.slint` UI with inline stub data; functional
integration is parked in Phase 8.

| Cluster | Source files (representative) | Target phase |
|---|---|---|
| Capture preview | `Stream/StreamView` | `PHASE-12-capture-preview.md` |
| Status badges (battery / thermal / network) | `ControlBar/{Battery,ThermalStateSheet}View` | `PHASE-13-status-badges-row.md` |
| Audio capture controls | `Settings/Audio/`, `ControlBar/QuickButton/QuickButtonMicView` | `PHASE-14-audio-capture-controls.md` |
| Camera capture controls | `Settings/Camera/{CameraSettings,CameraControls,MirrorFrontCamera,TapScreenToFocus,VideoStabilization,Zoom}` (8 files) | `PHASE-15-camera-capture-controls.md` |
| Bitrate & quality presets | `Settings/BitratePresets/`, `ControlBar/QuickButton/QuickButtonBitrateView` | `PHASE-16-bitrate-quality-presets.md` |
| Quick-action customization | `Settings/Display/QuickButtons/{QuickButtonsSettings,QuickButtonsButtonSettings}` | `PHASE-17-quick-action-customization.md` |
| Privacy & lifecycle modes | `Main/{LockScreen,StealthMode,SnapshotCountdown}View` | `PHASE-18-privacy-lifecycle-modes.md` |
| Settings backup & reset | `Settings/{ImportExport,Reset}/` | `PHASE-19-settings-backup-reset.md` |
| Cast history | `Settings/StreamingHistory/` | `PHASE-20-cast-history.md` |
| Help & support | `Settings/{About,HelpAndSupport}/` | `PHASE-21-help-and-support.md` |
| Network interface & Wi-Fi Aware | `Settings/Display/NetworkInterfaceNames/`, `Settings/WiFiAware/` | `PHASE-22-network-interface-wifi-aware.md` |
| Local recording | `Settings/Recordings/` | `PHASE-23-local-recording.md` |
| Pairing QR & receiver management | `Utils/{QrCodeImage,ContextMenu,SwipeLeftTo,NameEdit}` | `PHASE-24-pairing-qr-receiver-management.md` |
| Macros & action chains | `Settings/Macros/`, `ControlBar/QuickButton/QuickButtonMacrosView` | `PHASE-25-macros-action-chains.md` |
| Debug log viewer | `Settings/Debug/{Log,Video}` | `PHASE-26-debug-log-viewer.md` |
| Reusable utils backlog | `Utils/*` (remaining un-ported files) | `PHASE-27-utils-backlog.md` |

A row tagged `applicable-future` or `deferred — needs-rust-capability` in the
per-section tables below is now read as **"UI placeholder lives in the phase
above; real functionality lives in Phase 8 (deferred)"**. The original tags
are preserved so the audit trail of *why* the file was deferred remains
intact.

---

## Stream (23 files)

| File | Tag | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `CameraLevelView.swift` | not-applicable — defer | Camera horizon-level indicator. No camera level concept in FCast sender. |
| `DrawOnStreamView.swift` | not-applicable — defer | Live annotation drawing on broadcast. Not applicable to a cast remote; defer. |
| `Overlay/Right/AudioLevelView.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Right-side audio meter. *Component* (the level meter widget) could be extracted as part of an audio-controls phase, but the right-overlay layout is excluded. |
| `Overlay/Right/CameraSettingsControlView.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Right-overlay camera controls panel. |
| `Overlay/Right/MediaPlayerControlsView.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Right-overlay media-player transport controls (in-app player, not cast-target controls). |
| `Overlay/Right/ReplayView.swift` | not-applicable — replay | Live-stream replay UI. |
| `Overlay/Right/SceneSelectorView.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Right-overlay scene selector. |
| `Overlay/Right/SegmentedPicker.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Right-overlay segmented picker. *Component* could be reused if extracted; the right-overlay layout is excluded. |
| `Overlay/Right/StreamOverlayRightBeautyView.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Beauty filter overlay. |
| `Overlay/Right/StreamOverlayRightFaceView.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Face filter overlay. |

| `Overlay/StreamOverlayLeftView.swift` | not-applicable — defer | Left-side broadcast HUD layout (battery/thermal/uptime). The user's exclusion was right-side; left-side is technically not excluded, but FCast does not have a streamer broadcast layout, so the *layout* is not applicable. Individual badges (battery, thermal) tracked under `ControlBar/BatteryView.swift` and `ThermalStateSheetView.swift`. |
| `Overlay/StreamOverlayNavigationView.swift` | not-applicable — navigation | Navigation overlay. |
| `Overlay/StreamOverlayRightView.swift` | not-applicable — right-overlay | Right-side HUD root. |
| `StreamGridView.swift` | not-applicable — defer | Multi-camera grid composition. FCast captures one source. |
| `StreamOverlayView.swift` | not-applicable — defer | Top-level overlay coordinator. The `StatusOverlay` layer (Phase 5) is the FCast equivalent, but the broadcast-overlay coordinator concept does not apply. |
| `StreamView.swift` | applicable-future | Live capture preview window. Future capture-preview phase. |

## Utils (37 files)

| `VoicesView.swift` | not-applicable — chat | TTS voice picker. |

## WebBrowser (1 file)

| File | Tag | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `WebBrowser/WebBrowserView.swift` | not-applicable — defer | In-app web browser (Moblin uses it as a browser-source widget). FCast sender does not host an in-app browser. |

## Tally

Exact counts across all 279 Moblin view files (matches `wc -l draft/moblin-ui/VIEW_FILES.md`
minus section headers; `MainView.swift` is row 1 of the "MainView" section above):

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| applicable (covered in Phases 0–11) | 18 |
| applicable-future (could become a future phase) | 50 |
| deferred — needs-rust-capability | 11 |
| not-applicable — chat | 21 |
| not-applicable — navigation | 1 |
| not-applicable — replay | 2 |
| not-applicable — right-overlay | 13 |
| not-applicable — streaming-platform | 59 |
| not-applicable — scene-widget | 52 |
| not-applicable — peripheral-hardware | 22 |
| not-applicable — ios-target | 13 |
| not-applicable — iap | 1 |
| not-applicable — moblin-internal | 4 |
| not-applicable — defer (other) | 12 |
| **Total** | **279** |

About **75%** of Moblin's UI surface (~210 / 279 files) is **not applicable**
to a cast sender — Moblin is fundamentally a livestream-broadcast app with a
heavy scene/widget editor and many hardware integrations. The applicable subset
(~18 files = 6.5%) is already covered by Phases 0–11. The remaining
~50 `applicable-future` and ~11 `deferred` files are the realistic post-v1
backlog.

## Maintenance

When a new Moblin upstream release adds files:

1. Re-run the inventory script that produced `draft/moblin-ui/VIEW_FILES.md`
   (see `draft/moblin-ui/INFO.md`).
2. `diff` the new file list against the table above.
3. Add a row for each new file with the appropriate tag.
4. If a new Moblin feature falls outside the existing tag legend in
   [`README.md`](README.md), add the tag to both files.
